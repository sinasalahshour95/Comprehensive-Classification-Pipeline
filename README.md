#  Comprehensive Classification Pipeline
A complete Python-based machine learning project that demonstrates the entire workflow from raw data to trained model evaluation. This repository covers important steps like handling missing values, feature engineering, outlier detection, feature selection, and a comparative analysis of various classification algorithms.

# Project Overview
This project serves as a practical guide and framework for building a robust classification model. It emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing in the final performance of machine learning models. The code is structured to be modular and easily adaptable to different datasets.

# Features
-	Data Cleaning: Robust methods for handling missing or null values.
-	Feature Engineering: Techniques to create new, meaningful features from the existing data to improve model performance.
-	Outlier Analysis: Implementation of algorithms to detect and handle outliers that could skew the model's accuracy.
-	Feature Selection: Multiple strategies for selecting the most relevant features, including: Filter methods like Chi-Squared, correlation coefficients, Information Gain, Wrapper methods like RFE, forward/backward feature selection, Embedded methods like LASSO, and ...
-	Model Training: Training and evaluation of several popular classification models on different feature subsets.
-	Comparative Analysis: A clear comparison of model performance metrics (F1-Score) to determine the best-performing model and feature set.

# Models Implemented
The following machine learning models are trained and evaluated in this project:
1.	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2.	Logistic Regression
3.	Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel
4.	Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Polynomial Kernel
5.	Random Forest
6.	Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

# Dataset
This project utilizes the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. It contains 891 rows and 12 columns, with the primary objective of predicting the survived variable.
